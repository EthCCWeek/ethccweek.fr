### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://amsterdamblockchainweek.org/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:
  - We believe that crypto-native games — games that run entirely on-chain — will turn massively multiplayer games into fully-fledged digital worlds that outlast their creators. These worlds will be owned by their players — not just financially, but creatively, too, as players are empowered to build and govern both the mechanics and communities of the games they play. And they’ll be able to leverage the power of permissionless interoperability, allowing players to remix game rules and more, and taking the creative modding culture that’s brought us genre-defining games like Minecraft, Team Fight Tactics, and DayZ to new levels.
