synopsis:
  -
    Join us on Wednesday, July 21st, 2021 starting at 8 pm CET until 2 am (or whenever the night ends) at La Paillote situated on the serene Seine riverside. We will celebrate Ethereum, DeFi, and crypto in a no-holds barred slosh fest (obviously in reference to the snow. Drink responsibly).

    We will provide finger foods (vegan-friendly options available), drinks, and good conversation. We have plenty of ChainSafe swag to give out if you want to support our fam! Also, there will be ample opportunities for chilling and networking.
