title: Tenderly Rooftop Party @CafeOz

description: 
  No bullshit, just drinks. And food. And some great people hanging out (not) talking about blockchain - basically whatever floats your boat.

name: Tenderly Rooftop Party @CafeOz

synopsis:
  -
    Yes, we are making a party as well, and we don't have an agenda or any 'goals' for it - we just wanna have a good time with free drinks and food for everyone. And if you wanna talk blockchain we can do that as well, but it's not mandatory. What we do have is a fancy rooftop with great music really close to the EthCC venue, a private bar, just a bit of cool swag and good vibes - we are Tenderly after all.
  -
    Don't disappoint the party cat. Also, there aren't that many tickets - there's a joke about scarcity somewhere in there.
  -
    If you need to ping us, you can do it on our Discord - discord.gg/7wr32mTC.
