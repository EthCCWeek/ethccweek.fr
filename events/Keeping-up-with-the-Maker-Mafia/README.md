### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.fr/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:

    'This year has been an exciting one for MakerDAO - in line with the progressive decentralization principle, the Maker Foundation is dissolving and the community is getting bigger and stronger: we have witnessed the appearance of various core units that provide services directly to the DAO, and the formation of new companies that are part of the Maker ecosystem.'
  -
    'Curious to hear more from the people behind these? Or just seizing the opportunity to reconnect with your fellow Maker community? Join us in Paris on July 21th. More info will follow soon.'
