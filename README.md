<hr /><br /> 

In 2021, EthCC takes place in July, after more than one year with very few opportunities to gather the Ethereum community IRL. While EthCC itself will be the flagship event with more than 100 speakers coming from all over the world, multiple side events, meetups, panels and parties will take place on the same week in Paris.

This is the EthCC Week, a moment of inclusive conversations, educational gatherings, welcoming celebrations. If you're planning an event related to public blockchains and the decentralized movement, reach out to have it published on this website. 

Please be respectful of other events and minimize overlap.
