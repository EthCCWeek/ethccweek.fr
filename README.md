<hr /><br /> 

In 2022, DevConnect AMS takes place in April. While DevConnect AMS itself will be the flagship event for the Ethereum communities, more than 100 speakers coming from all over the world, multiple side events, meetups, panels and parties will also take place on the same week in Amsterdam.

This is the AMS Blockchain Week, a moment of inclusive conversations, educational gatherings, welcoming celebrations. If you're planning an event related to public blockchains and the decentralized movement, reach out to have it published on this website. 

Please be respectful of other events and minimize overlap.
