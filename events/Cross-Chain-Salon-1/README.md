title: Cross-Chain Salon

description: 
  We've taken over a gallery space and planned for a chic Parisian gathering for the melding of cross-chain minds. As we all work together to build the future of Web3, this is a space designed for all blockchain builders to hang out in Paris.

name: Cross-Chain Salon

synopsis:
  -
    Cross-chain is about more than bridging technology. It’s about acutely connecting the unique cultures of the ecosystems creating real change. The League of Bridges is a coalition that exists to drive home one point and one point only; all ecosystems need to work together — because in the world of web3 there are no winners or losers, just the infinite game.
  -
    Swing by the Cross-Chain Salon to meet fellow builders, hang out with friends, or find a space to chill (with coffee + high speed internet). There is an area for workshops and talks, and plenty of spaces to relax. We'll be open daily from 11am - 5pm.
