title: Why Do We DAO?

description: 
  Join us for a field trip to the origins of DAOing. While the growth in the space is exponential, let's take the time to think about what these organizations really mean, and to see what the big picture we are implementing with them truly looks like, to finally avoid repeating the age-old mistakes of human coordination.

name: Why Do We DAO?

synopsis:
  -
    Join us for an in-person in-nature conversation on the functions and the evolution of DAOs. Come share with us the reasons why you are DAOing!
  -
    While we talk, Sacha Saint-Leger and Aude Launay will guide us through the Bois de Vincennes, from an impressive medieval castle built to assert royal power, to the historic site of Parisâ€™s ghost experimental university born from the ashes of May 68 where the most prominent political thinkers taught (Foucault, Deleuze, Chomskyâ€¦), before the place was suddenly and violently shut down for being too radically leftist. Letâ€™s explore the paths from Maoism to Daoism.
