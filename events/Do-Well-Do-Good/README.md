### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.fr/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:

    Popcorn (https://popcorn.network) invites you to an evening with natural wine & charcuterie at La Grande Crèmerie, a cozy wine bar 15min away from EthCC, down the street from Point Neuf.
  -
    We’ve seen an incredible amount of wealth created in DeFi with increased protocol interoperability and liquidity allowing smart contracts to generate high returns for users. Surprisingly, there are close to zero DeFi protocols that allocate a percentage of revenue towards Social Impact. Blue chip centralized exchanges such as Binance and FTX donate to charitable organizations, however total earmarked funds thus far are microscopic compared to the $ billions in daily volume.
  -
    Smart contracts present the opportunity to bake social good into DeFi by contributing a substantial percentage of fees to create real world impact. And what about carbon credits or carbon offsets as a new asset class that can be baked into DeFi protocols. Let's discuss what we can do to improve DeFi!
