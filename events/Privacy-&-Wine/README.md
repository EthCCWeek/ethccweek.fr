title: Privacy & Wine

description: 
  Meet the team building Anoma & other developers & researchers working on open-source privacy-preserving / -enhancing technology

name: Privacy & Wine

synopsis:
  -
    What is end-to-end privacy? Why should we care about end-to-end privacy? What is being built and/or needs to be built to achieve it?
  -
    In the evening of the first day of ETHCC, meet the team building Anoma, developers, and researchers working on other protocols and open-source technology that aim to make privacy-preserving technologies accessible for as many as possible.
  -
    This is an informal gathering with an ice-breaking panel discussion on end-to-end privacy. Meet with folks driven by making an alternative end-state possible, where surveillance capitalism and financial systems are not susceptible to capture by nation states– motifs that are best combined with a glass of wine - or any other fermented, distilled drinks or combinations of the latter are also provided.
